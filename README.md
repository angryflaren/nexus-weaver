## 📖 About the Project

Do you need to give your project code to an AI like GPT? Copying every file is slow and boring. It is easy to miss a file.

**Nexus Weaver** fixes this problem. It is a web app that works in your browser. It helps you:
1.  Drag your project folder into the browser.
2.  See a list of all your files and choose the ones you want.
3.  Click one button to "weave" (combine) all files into one big, clean text file.

This project was made with help from an AI assistant to build a useful tool for the developer community.

**Main technologies used:**
* React.js
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS

## ✨ Key Features

* **Works in Browser**: No install needed. Your files stay on your computer. They are safe and private.
* **Drag & Drop**: Just drop your folder to start. It's very easy.
* **Smart Ignore**: It knows not to include folders like `node_modules` or `.git`. This saves you time.
* **Handles Images & Docs**: It can turn images and documents into text (using Base64) so they can be included.
* **Easy Output**: Copy the final text with one click, or download it as a `.txt` file.
* **Dark Mode**: Good for your eyes when you work at night.
